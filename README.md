## Purpose
Listen to your favorite music while you browse world-famous artwork from the Metropolitan Museum of Art! A fun, chilled out app experience to inspire creativity, educate those curious about the world's art and culture, or to simply look at beautiful images while enjoying your favorite tunes. This application allows the user to 

* Browse a randomized collection of the Met Museum's database of over 700k art relics and paintings

* Search for unique artists by name/ culture/ era

* When the user 'searches' either via random or specified choice, the image, as well as a description/ artist name/ date will show up (if that data has been made available to us by the Met)

* Afterwards, if the user searches for a particular genre, artist, or type of music, then a playlist of that music will generate that will pair the art!

## Built With
* HTML
* CSS
* Materialize CSS Framework
